JD to teach stepR about .rmd

Steve to clean up the .html
* Clearer labelling (bigger fonts)
* Focus on things that are interesting, or that we have clear questions (for now). You can leave other stuff in the .rda but don't need to show it for now in the .html.

Questions for Damazo. 
* What is the pattern in overall deaths by time? We need to know more about the sampling, so we can try to make sense of that.
* What are the other deaths which account for the majority of reports? How do we get more information about those?
